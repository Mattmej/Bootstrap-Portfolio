                <p>
                    Hi. I'm Matt Mejia, and I combine a methodical approach to problems with a compassionate approach to people. I have a Bachelor
                    of Arts in physics, which I have put to use by helping students through substitute teaching and tutoring.
                    I serve as a substitute teacher at Flintridge Preparatory School in La Canada, and I tutor students in
                    the San Gabriel Valley area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a substitute teacher I specialize in math and physics. My greatest achievement is teaching an AP Calculus class for a
                    month while the class' instructor attended an important math conference. Keeping track of the instructor's
                    notes, teaching the lesson effectively, and adapting to the students' questions were challenging, but
                    these challenges were rewarding for me when the students smiled and told me "thank you."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tutor students in math, physics, and test preparation. The best part of personal tutoring is seeing my students' faces
                    light up with comprehension and their parents' faces light up with pride. Students vouch for my ability
                    to make hard subjects easier, and several thankful parents tell me that I have helped raise their children's
                    SAT scores by as much as 100 points. I hope that by helping my students with difficult topics I can help
                    them with fostering a growth mindset and building self-confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I look forward to helping you with your needs, whether they be related to programming or teaching. Thank you for visiting
                    my page!
                </p>
